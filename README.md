# atat-js
AT-AT is a micro-template framework designed to act like a tag-based interface for JavaScript.

**Synopsis**

The aim of AT-AT is to provide a programming interface similar to tag-based languages like PHP, ColdFusion and ASP Classic, but with JavaScript. Code is activated using `<@ JavaScript commands @>` and can be used to surround code for more powerful programming. Values are rendered out using `<@= variable @>`. 

**Upcoming Features**

I'm planning on extending the AT-AT framework with extended JavaScript commands emulating BASIC programming functionality to provide more powerful code to this framework.
